# CLAUDE.md — Isaac GR00T N1.7

## Project overview

Isaac GR00T N1.7 is an open vision-language-action (VLA) model for generalized humanoid robot skills.
The repo contains the model, training pipeline, evaluation harness, and deployment tooling.

- **Language:** Python 3.10 (dGPU, Orin); Python 3.12 (Thor, DGX Spark — see deployment dir)
- **Package manager:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Build system:** setuptools (see `pyproject.toml`)
- **CI:** internal GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml` + includes under `ci/`, not shipped to the public GitHub EA repo); public GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)

## Agent behavior guidelines

These guidelines reduce common LLM coding mistakes and should be merged with project-specific
instructions when they overlap. They bias toward caution over speed; use judgment for trivial tasks.

### 1. Think before coding

Do not assume, hide confusion, or skip tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of choosing silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what is confusing, and ask.

### 2. Simplicity first

Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Do not add speculative behavior.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical changes

Touch only what is necessary. Clean up only changes introduced by the current work.

When editing existing code:

- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if another style seems preferable.
- If unrelated dead code is noticed, mention it instead of deleting it.

When changes create unused code:

- Remove imports, variables, functions, or files made unused by the current changes.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-driven execution

Define success criteria and loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria allow independent progress. Weak criteria, such as "make it work", require
clarification.

### 5. Commit completed code changes

After each completed code change, create one git commit for that change.

- Stage only files directly related to the completed change.
- Do not include unrelated worktree changes in the commit.
- Keep the commit message concise and specific to the change.

These guidelines are working when diffs contain fewer unnecessary changes, fewer rewrites are needed
because of overcomplication, and clarifying questions happen before implementation mistakes.

## Quick-start commands

```bash
# Install (dev mode with all extras)
uv sync --all-extras

# Lint and format (uses ruff via pre-commit)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run CPU tests
python -m pytest tests/ -m "not gpu" -v --timeout=300

# Run GPU tests
python -m pytest tests/ -m gpu -v --timeout=300

# Build package
uv build

# Validate lockfile
uv lock --locked
```

## Code style

- Formatter: `ruff format` (double quotes, spaces, line-length 100)
- Linter: `ruff check` with rules E, F, I (ignores E501)
- Config lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing

```

## Key entry points

- **Fine-tune:** `bash examples/finetune.sh --base-model-path <path> --dataset-path <path> --embodiment-tag <tag> --output-dir <dir>`
- **Inference server:** `python gr00t/eval/run_gr00t_server.py --model-path <path> --embodiment-tag <tag>`
- **ONNX export:** `python scripts/deployment/export_onnx_n1d7.py`
- **TensorRT build:** `python scripts/deployment/build_trt_pipeline.py`
- **Benchmark:** `python scripts/deployment/benchmark_inference.py`

## Testing

- Test markers: `gpu` (requires GPU), default is CPU-safe
- Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/` and `demo_data/`
- CI runs CPU and GPU tests in separate jobs with 300s timeout

## Deployment platforms

- **dGPU (H100, A100, RTX):** CUDA 12.8 — install via `scripts/deployment/dgpu/install_deps.sh`, container via top-level `docker/Dockerfile` (supports x86_64 and aarch64)
- **Jetson Orin:** CUDA 12.6 — install via `scripts/deployment/orin/install_deps.sh`, container via `scripts/deployment/orin/Dockerfile`
- **Jetson Thor:** CUDA 13.0 — install via `scripts/deployment/thor/install_deps.sh`, container via `scripts/deployment/thor/Dockerfile`
- **DGX Spark:** CUDA 13.0 — install via `scripts/deployment/spark/install_deps.sh`, container via `scripts/deployment/spark/Dockerfile`

Each Jetson/Spark platform ships an `activate_*.sh` helper (`scripts/activate_orin.sh`, `scripts/activate_spark.sh`, `scripts/activate_thor.sh`) that exports platform-specific library paths. For dGPU, the standard `source .venv/bin/activate` is sufficient.
